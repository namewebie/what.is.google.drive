* Google Drive is a cloud storage service, and like all cloud services, its primary function is to take some load off your hard drive. Cloud storage works by uploading your files to its own remote servers — or the “cloud” — freeing up space on your computer. This leaves more space on your devices for more important things, like installing large apps and games.

* However, cloud services offer many more advantages over traditional storage. When your files are in the cloud, you can access them from wherever you are with any device with an internet connection. Plus, you can share them with other people, which opens up new avenues for online collaboration (read our piece on why online storage is useful).

* If you have a Google account, you already have Google Drive, too. Simply signing up for an account gets you 15GB of free storage, which puts its free plan near the top of our best free cloud storage list.

* vHowever, Google uses Drive for Google Photos storage, as well as storing your Gmail attachments and Google Workspace documents, which can take up a lot of that space (read our guide on how to remove Google Photos duplicates if you find you have uploaded multiple copies).

* This means that you might want to upgrade to a paid plan. Luckily, Drive’s prices are pretty flexible, and it can likely accommodate whatever your needs are. If you only need a slight upgrade, you can get the 100GB plan for only $1.99 per month. If that’s still not enough, its 2TB plan comes at a monthly cost of just $9.99.

* Unfortunately, Google has often come under fire for its suspicious privacy policies, and Drive is no exception to the controversy. Google gives itself permission to scan any Drive file it wants. Plus, there’s no zero-knowledge encryption, which means Google holds all encryption keys to your files and can view them whenever it wants to.

* Thankfully, there are ways to encrypt your data, if you’re particularly concerned about privacy. Encrypting your files using an encryption service, such as Boxcryptor, before you upload them to the cloud ensures that no one can scan or view them without your permission.
